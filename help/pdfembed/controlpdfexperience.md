   You should see the Technical Whitepaper render in a Full Window mode within your browser.

## Part 3: Accessing Analytics APIs {#part3}

Now that you've successfully created a web page that has PDF Embed API rendering a PDF, in part 3 you can now explore how to use JavaScript events to measure analytics to understand how users are using PDFs.

### Finding documentation

There are a lot of different JavaScript events available as part of PDF Embed API. You can access them from Adobe Document Services documentation.

1. Navigate to the [documentation](https://www.adobe.io/apis/documentcloud/dcsdk/docs.html) site.
1. Review the different event types available as part of the API. These are helpful for reference and will also be helpful for your future projects.

   ![Screenshot of reference guide](assets/ControlPDF_17.png)

1. Copy the sample code listed on the website.

   Use this as the basis for our code and modify it.

   ![Screenshot of where to copy sample code](assets/ControlPDF_18.png)

   ```
   const eventOptions = {
     //Pass the PDF analytics events to receive.
      //If no event is passed in listenOn, then all PDF 		analytics events will be received.
   listenOn: [ AdobeDC.View.Enum.PDFAnalyticsEvents.	PAGE_VIEW, AdobeDC.View.Enum.PDFAnalyticsEvents.DOCUMENT_DOWNLOAD],
     enablePDFAnalytics: true
   }


   adobeDCView.registerCallback(
     AdobeDC.View.Enum.CallbackType.EVENT_LISTENER,
     function(event) {
       console.log(“Type “ + event.type);
       console.log(“Data “ + event.data);
     }, eventOptions
   );
   ```

1. Find the code section you added earlier that looks like the below and append the code above after this code in **index.html**:

   ![Screenshot of where to paste code](assets/ControlPDF_19.png)

1. Load the page in your web browser, and open the Console to view the console outputs from the different events as you interact with the PDF viewer. 

   ![Screenshot of loading the page](assets/ControlPDF_20.png)

   ![Screenshot of the code for loading the page](assets/ControlPDF_21.png)

### Add switch for capturing events

Now that you have the events being outputted to console.log, let's change the behavior based on which events. To do this, you'll use a switch example.

1. Navigate to **snippets/eventsSwitch.js** and copy the contents of the file in the tutorial code.

   ![Screenshot of where to copy code](assets/ControlPDF_22.png)

1. Paste the code in the event listener function.

   ![Screenshot of where to paste code](assets/ControlPDF_23.png)

1. Confirm that the console outputs correctly when the page is loaded and you interact with the PDF Viewer.

### Adobe Analytics

If you want to add Adobe Analytics support to your viewer, you can follow the instructions documented on the website. 

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Your webpage needs to already have Adobe Analytics loaded on the page in the header.

Navigate to the [Adobe Analytics documentation](https://www.adobe.com/devnet-docs/dcsdk_io/viewSDK/howtodata.html#adobe-analytics) and review if you already have Adobe Analytics enabled on your webpage. Follow instructions to set up a reportSuite.

### Google Analytics

![Screenshot of how to integrate with Google Analytics](assets/ControlPDF_24.png)

Adobe PDF Embed API provides out-of-box integration with Adobe Analytics. However, because all events are available as JavaScript events, it is possible to integrate with Google Analytics by capturing PDF events and using the ga() function to add the event to Adobe Analytics.

1. Navigate to **snippets/eventsSwitchGA.js** to see how you can integrate with Google Analytics.
1. Review and use this code as an example if your webpage is tracked using Adobe Analytics and it is already embedded on the webpage.

   ![Screenshot of Adobe Analytics code](assets/ControlPDF_25.png)

## Part 4: Add interactivity based on events {#part4}

In part 4, you'll walk through how to layer on top of your PDF viewer a paywall that shows after you scroll past the second page.

### Paywall example

Navigate to this [example of a PDF behind a paywall](https://www3.technologyevaluation.com/research/white-paper/the-forrester-wave-digital-decisioning-platforms-q4-2020.html). In this example, you'll learn to add interactivity on top of a PDF viewing experience.

### Add paywall code

1. Go to snippets/paywallCode.html and copy the contents.
1. Search for `<!-- TODO: EXERCISE 3: INSERT PAYWALL CODE -->` in exercise/index.html.

   ![Screenshot of where to copy code](assets/ControlPDF_26.png)

1. Paste the copied code after the comment.
1. Go to **snippets/paywallCode.js** and copy the contents.

   ![Screenshot of where to paste code](assets/ControlPDF_27.png)

1. Paste the code into that location.

### Try Demo with Paywall

Now you can view the demo.

1. Reload **index.html** on your website.
1. Scroll down to a page > 2.
1. Show the dialog come up to challenge user after the second page.

   ![Screenshot of viewing the demo](assets/ControlPDF_28.png)
